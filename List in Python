A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements.
Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ]

Example:-
states_of_india = ["Maharashtra", "Gujrat", "Delhi", "Karnataka", "Tamil Nadu", "Bihar"]
print(states_of_india[5])

states_of_india.append("Rajasthan")
print(states_of_india)
states_of_india.extend(["Punjab", "Haryana"])
print(states_of_india)
